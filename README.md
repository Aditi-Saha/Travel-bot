# Travel-bot
The travel industry is constantly evolving, and with the rise of technology, the way we book, and plan travel is changing rapidly. Travel booking has traditionally been a time-consuming and often frustrating process, with users having to navigate multiple travel websites, input their preferences repeatedly, and perform tedious data entry tasks.
To address these issues, the travel bot has been developed using UiPath, an automation solution that aims to simplify the travel booking process. The travel bot takes input from the user about their desired destination, travel dates, and email address, and then navigates through travel websites, extracts the relevant information, compiles it into an Excel file, and sends it to the user's email address.
The travel bot is an innovative tool that streamlines the travel booking process, saving users time, money, and hassle. By eliminating the need for manual data entry and allowing users to quickly compare prices and availability across multiple travel websites, the travel bot offers a faster and more convenient way to book travel.
